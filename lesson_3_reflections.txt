When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to collaborate or share your work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may want to work on a different or older version of the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are done entirely within github, and allow you to make a unique copy of someone's project into your own github profile.  Cloning takes a public github repository and creates a local copy onto your computer.  Branches are tangents of a project that represent major experimental versions or versions meant for different groups (development teams, public release, management, etc.).
Use forks for creating a copy of someone's project onto your own github.  Use cloning to get a fork or project locally onto your computer.  Use branches when you want to try implementing a major feature or version of a project.
